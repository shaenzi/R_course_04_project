# Technical stuff

- where should I run the data loading?
- where can I load the data so that it is also accessible to the ui? (needed for sensible input choices)
- how can/should I test the module?

# UI considerations

- make the module in a kind of card?
- general layout? add text/about/possibly another plot
- the map legend is tiny
- not sure about the table [widths](https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/examples.html#column-resizing), column names, their alignment etc.
- general low-key effort to improve the table?
- what kind of input? drop down, radio button, ...
- mobile? 


# Content considerations

## Locations

it would be nice to add the locations from where the emergency services start?
see [ambulances](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/pd/de/index/schutz_u_rettung_zuerich/sanitaet/so_arbeiten_wir/rettungsdienstwachen.html) and [fire services](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/pd/de/index/schutz_u_rettung_zuerich/feuerwehr/wir_ueber_uns/einsatzgebiet.html)
would have to manually parse/add those 6 addresses to a small dataset

## Lake

Better to take out the lake in the map?
