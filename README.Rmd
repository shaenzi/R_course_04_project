# c4app

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This shiny app is a project done as part of the [EPFL's](https://www.extensionschool.ch/) Data visualisation and communication [course](https://www.extensionschool.ch/learn/applied-data-science-communication-visualization). 

Once I am done I will most likely put it on [shinyapps.io](https://shaenzi.shinyapps.io/c4app/), so you can try it live :-) The link might not work anymore if I have too many apps for my free account...

The data shown is from the [open government data portal from the city of zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset?q=schutz+und+rettung) and concerns the emergency services: How fast do they respond? Which areas ("Stadtkreise") of the city do they reach within the target time of 10 minutes?

## Installation

You can install the development version of c4app from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shaenzi/R_course_04_project")
```
